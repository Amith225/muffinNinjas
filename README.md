This project addresses field placements in cricket matches (especially T20) and allows fielding coaches and teams to optimize their field placement. 
While there are several cricket softwares, we were not able to find any open source or free ones with this functionality.

The software uses previous batting statistics that may be easily calculated and stored in csv files to calculate the average runs scored per ball. 
The user may change the field positions and attempt to reduce the run per ball.
We have also added functionality for the user to easily modify properties such as running speed, throwing speed etc. of each fielder.

This project is entirely in python with the GUI using tkinter. There is lots of room for further development with the user interface, as well as adding new features.
